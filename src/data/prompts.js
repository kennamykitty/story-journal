export const tips = [
  "Start in the middle of the action. Your reader doesn't need the backstory — they need to be inside the scene.",
  "Pick one specific sensory detail. Not 'the room smelled old' — 'the room smelled of cedar and something burnt.'",
  "What does your character want right now, in this exact moment? Let that drive every sentence.",
  "Show emotion through the body — a clenched jaw, a held breath, hands that won't stay still. Skip the word for it.",
  "Conflict doesn't have to be dramatic. Two people wanting different things in the same room is enough.",
  "Let your character make a choice, even a small one. Choice is what reveals who someone really is.",
  "Write the scene as if you're watching it happen. What do you see first? Start there.",
  "Cut your first sentence. Your real opening is almost always the second one.",
  "Good dialogue does two things at once — moves the scene forward and reveals something about the person speaking.",
  "End the scene one beat before the obvious moment. Stop early and let the reader lean in.",
  "The way a character describes a room tells us more about them than about the room.",
  "Don't explain the emotion. Trust your reader. Write what happens, and let them feel it.",
  "The most interesting moment is usually the one right before the obvious one.",
  "Specific nouns beat adjectives every time. Not 'a nice car' — 'a dented Volvo with a cracked bumper sticker.'",
  "Silence in dialogue matters as much as the words. What a character doesn't say is part of the story.",
  "Every scene needs a small change — something is different at the end than it was at the beginning.",
  "Put your character in a situation where two things they care about are in conflict.",
  "The first draft is for you. Write it badly. Get the shape of it on the page.",
  "Zoom in on one moment and slow it down. The reader will feel it more than a summary ever could.",
  "When you're stuck, ask: what's the worst thing that could happen to this character right now?",
